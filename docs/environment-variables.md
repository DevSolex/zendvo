# Environment Variables

This document lists all the environment variables required for the Zendvo backend.

## AWS S3 Configuration (Image Upload)

The following environment variables are required for the image upload feature:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key ID for S3 access
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret access key for S3 access
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region where the S3 bucket is located (default: us-east-1)
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME` - Name of the S3 bucket for storing uploaded images

### Example

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=zendvo-uploads
```

### S3 Bucket Setup

1. Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account
2. Configure the bucket with public read access for the uploaded files via bucket policy or CDN
3. Set up CORS if needed for your frontend domain
4. Ensure the IAM user/role has the following permissions:
   - `s3:PutObject`
5. For IAM role/instance profile deployments, omit AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to use default credential chain

### Security Notes

- Never commit actual AWS credentials to version control
- Use IAM roles with least privilege in production
- Consider using AWS S3 bucket policies instead of ACLs for better security
- Enable server-side encryption for uploaded files
